### Purpose
This test checks how the placing tool handles an invalid input file, verifying that it alerts the user about the file's invalid content and exits without processing.

### Pre-requisites
* Java runtime 22
* mappingToPlacing.xml exists in the placing-1.5.0.jar's folder and is a valid inputFile (produced by mapping-1.5.0.jar with the cdfFile generated by converter-1.5.0.jar for the input codemetropolis-toolchain-commons.graph)
* command line opened in the folder of placing-1.5.0.jar

### Steps
1. Open mappingToPlacing.xml with a text editor
2. Delete content from line 10 to 20 and save the file
3. Run:
	```cmd
	java -jar placing-1.5.0.jar -i mappingToPlacing.xml
	```

### Expected result
The tool warns the user that the input file content is invalid and exits normally without creating the output file.
