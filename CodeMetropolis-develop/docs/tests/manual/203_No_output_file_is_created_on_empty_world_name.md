### Purpose
 The purpose of this test is to see if the solution committed to issue no. #203 will create any kind of output file when running the program. The type of the output file would not matter the only thing that is tested to see if a file is created after running the program or not and only a console message will be written out.

### Test File
- [[validPlacingToRendering.xml]]

### Pre-requisites
- Java runtime 22
- Command line opened in the folder of rendering-1.5.0.jar
- A *validPlacingToRendering.xml* file exists in the rendering-1.5.0.jar's folder. (Has to be a valid file, which was produced by running placing-1.5.0.jar with the *mappingToPlacing.xml* as input, which was generated by mapping-1.5.0.jar with the *cdfFile* generated by converter-1.5.0.jar with codemetropolis-toolchain-commons.graph as input)

### Steps
1. Run:
   ```cmd
   java -jar rendering-1.5.0.jar -i validPlacingToRendering.xml -w
   ```
 in rendering-1.5.0.jar command line

### Expected Result
The tool warns the user that the world path parameter's name value is missing then it ends the run of the program without errors and without creating any kind of output file.
