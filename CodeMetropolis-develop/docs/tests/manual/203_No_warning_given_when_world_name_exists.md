### Purpose
The purpose of this test is to see if the solution committed to issue no. #203 will give back a warning message when a world path parameter is given.

### Test File
- [[validPlacingToRendering.xml]]

### Pre-requisites
- Java runtime 22
- Command line opened in the folder of rendering-1.5.0.jar
- A *validPlacingToRendering.xml* file exists in the rendering-1.5.0.jar's folder. (Has to be a valid file, which was produced by running placing-1.5.0.jar with the *mappingToPlacing.xml* as input, which was generated by mapping-1.5.0.jar with the *cdfFile* generated by converter-1.5.0.jar with codemetropolis-toolchain-commons.graph as input)

### Steps
1. Run the following command in the folder of rendering-1.5.0.jar:
	```cmd
	java -jar rendering-1.5.0.jar -i validPlacingToRendering.xml -w world
	``` 

### Expected Result
The tool will not give back any warning messages on the console instead it runs as intended and creates the Minecraft world using the path parameter.
