_Related branch:_ https://github.com/codemetropolis/CodeMetropolis/tree/199-rendering-with-invalid-inputfile-is-not-handled-correctly

### Purpose
The purpose of this test is to see that the solution committed to issue no. #199 runs as intended and exits out normally (while not giving back a warning) when the *-i* switch and it's parameter is swapped. Under normal working conditions the rendering tool should accept swapped *-i* switch and it's parameter if the input is valid.

### Test File
- [[validPlacingToRendering.xml]]

### Pre-requisites	
- Java runtime 22
- Command line opened in the folder of rendering-1.5.0.jar
- A *validPlacingToRendering.xml* file exists in the rendering-1.5.0.jar's folder. (Has to be a valid file, which was produced by running placing-1.5.0.jar with the *mappingToPlacing.xml* as input, which was generated by mapping-1.5.0.jar with the *cdfFile* generated by converter-1.5.0.jar with codemetropolis-toolchain-commons.graph as input)

### Steps
1. Run the following command in the folder of rendering-1.5.0.jar:
	```cmd
	java -jar rendering-1.5.0.jar -w world -i validPlacingToRendering.xml
	``` 

### Expected Result
No warning appears in the console and the tool finishes running as intended
