_Related branch:_ https://github.com/codemetropolis/CodeMetropolis/tree/203-rendering-with-empty-world-parameter-is-not-handled-correctly

### Purpose
The purpose of this test is to see if the program runs when the world path parameter is used before the *-i* switch with a world name correctly attached to it, and the solution committed to issue no. #203 won't create errors.

### Test File
- [[validPlacingToRendering.xml]]

### Pre-requisites
- Java runtime 22
- Command line opened in the folder of rendering-1.5.0.jar
- A *validPlacingToRendering.xml* file exists in the rendering-1.5.0.jar's folder. (Has to be a valid file, which was produced by running placing-1.5.0.jar with the *mappingToPlacing.xml* as input, which was generated by mapping-1.5.0.jar with the *cdfFile* generated by converter-1.5.0.jar with codemetropolis-toolchain-commons.graph as input)

### Steps
1.  Run the following command in the folder of rendering-1.5.0.jar:
	```cmd
	java -jar rendering-1.5.0.jar -w world -i validPlacingToRendering.xml
	```

### Expected Result
The program runs normally creating a Minecraft world at the end of it.
