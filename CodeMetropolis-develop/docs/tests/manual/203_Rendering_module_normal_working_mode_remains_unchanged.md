_Related branch:_ https://github.com/codemetropolis/CodeMetropolis/tree/203-rendering-with-empty-world-parameter-is-not-handled-correctly

### Purpose
The purpose of this test is to see if the solution committed to issue no. #203 will not change anything on the rendering tool's normal working mode and as such will not prevent the creation of the specified output folder.

### Test File
- [[validPlacingToRendering.xml]]

### Pre-requisites
- Java runtime 22
- Command line opened in the folder of rendering-1.5.0.jar
- A *validPlacingToRendering.xml* file exists in the rendering-1.5.0.jar's folder. (Has to be a valid file, which was produced by running placing-1.5.0.jar with the *mappingToPlacing.xml* as input, which was generated by mapping-1.5.0.jar with the *cdfFile* generated by converter-1.5.0.jar with codemetropolis-toolchain-commons.graph as input)

### Steps
1. Run the following command in the folder of rendering-1.5.0.jar:
	```cmd
	java -jar rendering-1.5.0.jar -i validPlacingToRendering.xml -w world
	```
2. Check the folder of `\CodeMetropolis\sources` and see if a folder named world is created
3. Check the folder of `\CodeMetropolis\sources\world` and see if it is empty or not

### Expected Result
A world named folder, which is also not empty, appears in the sources folder and thus the solution to the issue does not prevent the creation of the specified folder.
