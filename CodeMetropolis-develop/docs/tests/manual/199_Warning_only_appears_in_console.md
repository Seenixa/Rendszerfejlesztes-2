_Related branch:_ https://github.com/codemetropolis/CodeMetropolis/tree/199-rendering-with-invalid-inputfile-is-not-handled-correctly

### Purpose
The purpose of this test is to see if the solution committed to issue no. #199 only writes the warning message (when rendering tool is ran with a invalid input file) in the console and no output file is created for this message.

### Test File
- [[validPlacingToRendering.xml]]

### Pre-requisites
- Java runtime 22
- Command line opened in the folder of rendering-1.5.0.jar
- A *validPlacingToRendering.xml* file exists in the rendering-1.5.0.jar's folder. (Has to be a valid file, which was produced by running placing-1.5.0.jar with the *mappingToPlacing.xml* as input, which was generated by mapping-1.5.0.jar with the *cdfFile* generated by converter-1.5.0.jar with codemetropolis-toolchain-commons.graph as input)

### Steps
1. Open placingToRendering.xml in any kind of text editor
2. Delete its content from line 10 to 20 and save the file
3. Run the following command in the folder of rendering-1.5.0.jar:
   ```cmd
   java -jar rendering-1.5.0.jar -i validPlacingToRendering.xml -w world
   ```

### Expected Result
The warning for the invalid input file only appears in console and no output file is created for it.
