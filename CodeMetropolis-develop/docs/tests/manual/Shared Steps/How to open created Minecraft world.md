# The step by step guide to place a Minecraft world created by CodeMetropolis into your game and open it.

**Steps:**
1. Find the Minecraft world created by CodeMetropolis's **rendering-1.5.0.jar** file. It is usually in the `CodeMetropolis\sources` folder under the default name **world** if it hasn't been changed otherwise.
2.  Copy this *world* folder
3.  Hit **win + R** on your keyboard and type `%appdata%`. This will take you your PC's Roaming folder where you will likely find a *.minecraft* folder
4.  Open the *.minecraft* folder then open the *saves* folder
5. Paste the previously copied Minecraft world into this folder
6. Open Minecraft 1.20 and choose Singleplayer. Here you should find an existing world.
7. Open the existing world.
