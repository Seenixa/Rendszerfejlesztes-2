### Purpose
This test evaluates the rendering tool's functionality when an existing world folder is specified, ensuring it processes the input without attempting to recreate the existing folder.

### Pre-requisites
* Java runtime 22
* placingToRendering.xml exists in the rendering-1.5.0.jar's folder and is a valid inputFile (produced by placing-1.5.0.jar with the mappingToPlacing.xml as input generated by mapping-1.5.0.jar with the cdfFile generated by converter-1.5.0.jar for the input codemetropolis-toolchain-commons.graph)
* command line opened in the folder of rendering-1.5.0.jar		

### Steps
1. Run:
   ```cmd
   java -jar rendering-1.5.0.jar -i placingToRendering.xml -w cm
   ```
2. Run again 
   ```cmd
   java -jar rendering-1.5.0.jar -i placingToRendering.xml -w cm
   ```

### Expected result
The tool detects that the world folder already exists and outputs the following confirmation question to the user in the console: "Rendering: Another world with the same name might exist or being built right now. Do you want to overwrite? [Y/N]"
