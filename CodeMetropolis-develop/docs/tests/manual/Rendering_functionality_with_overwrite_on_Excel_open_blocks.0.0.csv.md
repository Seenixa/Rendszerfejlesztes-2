### Purpose
This test evaluates the rendering tool's behavior when attempting to overwrite a world folder while a related file is open in Excel, ensuring the tool prompts the user and handles the denial of deletion appropriately.

### Pre-requisites
* Java runtime 22
* placingToRendering.xml exists in the rendering-1.5.0.jar's folder and is a valid inputFile (produced by placing-1.5.0.jar with the mappingToPlacing.xml as input generated by mapping-1.5.0.jar with the cdfFile generated by converter-1.5.0.jar for the input codemetropolis-toolchain-commons.graph)
* command line opened in the folder of rendering-1.5.0.jar

### Steps
1. Run:
```cmd
java -jar rendering-1.5.0.jar -i placingToRendering.xml -w cm
``` 
2. Open the generated file "cm/TEMP/blocks.0.0.csv" with Excel
3. Run again the very same command 
```cmd
java -jar rendering-1.5.0.jar -i placingToRendering.xml -w cm
```
4. When the prompt asks "Rendering: Another world with the same name might exist or being built right now. Do you want to overwrite? [Y/N]" hit "Y"

### Expected result
The tool exits normally, warning the user that the "blocks.0.0.csv" file in the target "cm" folder cannot be deleted and does not regenerate the world.
