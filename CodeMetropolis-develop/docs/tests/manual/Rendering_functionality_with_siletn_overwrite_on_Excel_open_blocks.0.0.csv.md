### Purpose
This test verifies the rendering tool's functionality when set to silently overwrite a world folder with open files, confirming that it attempts to overwrite without user interaction and appropriately handles file lock errors.

### Pre-requisites
* Java runtime 22
* placingToRendering.xml exists in the rendering-1.5.0.jar's folder and is a valid inputFile (produced by placing-1.5.0.jar with the mappingToPlacing.xml as input generated by mapping-1.5.0.jar with the cdfFile generated by converter-1.5.0.jar for the input codemetropolis-toolchain-commons.graph)
* command line opened in the folder of rendering-1.5.0.jar
 
### Steps
1. Run:
   ```cmd
   java -jar rendering-1.5.0.jar -i placingToRendering.xml -w cm
   ``` 
2. Open the generated file "cm/TEMP/blocks.0.0.csv" with Excel
3. Run:
   ```cmd
   java -jar rendering-1.5.0.jar -i placingToRendering.xml -w cm -s
   ```        

### Expected result
The tool exits normally, warning the user that the "blocks.0.0.csv" file in the target "cm" folder cannot be deleted and does not regenerate the world.
