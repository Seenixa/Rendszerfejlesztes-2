_Related branch:_ https://github.com/codemetropolis/CodeMetropolis/tree/199-rendering-with-invalid-inputfile-is-not-handled-correctly

### Purpose
The purpose of this test is to see that the solution committed to issue no. #199 gives back a warning when the *-i* switch is swapped and used with invalid input. Under normal working conditions the rendering tool should accept swapped *-i* switch and it's parameter if the input is valid.

### Test File
- [[validPlacingToRendering.xml]]

### Pre-requisites
- Java runtime 22
- Command line opened in the folder of rendering-1.5.0.jar
- A *validPlacingToRendering.xml* file exists in the rendering-1.5.0.jar's folder. (Has to be a valid file, which was produced by running placing-1.5.0.jar with the *mappingToPlacing.xml* as input, which was generated by mapping-1.5.0.jar with the *cdfFile* generated by converter-1.5.0.jar with codemetropolis-toolchain-commons.graph as input)

### Steps
1. Open validPlacingToRendering.xml in any kind of text editor
2. Delete its content from line 10 to 20 and save the file
3. Run the following command in the folder of rendering-1.5.0.jar:
	```cmd
	java -jar rendering-1.5.0.jar -w world -i validPlacingToRendering.xml
	``` 

### Expected Result
Warning message appears in the console about the invalid input of the *-i* switch and the program does not finish running.
