_Related branch:_ https://github.com/codemetropolis/CodeMetropolis/tree/203-rendering-with-empty-world-parameter-is-not-handled-correctly

### Purpose
 The purpose of this test is to check if the issue's solution still works when the world path parameter is used before the *-i* switch.

### Test File
- [[validPlacingToRendering.xml]]

### Pre-requisites	
- Java runtime 22
- Command line opened in the folder of rendering-1.5.0.jar
- A *validPlacingToRendering.xml* file exists in the rendering-1.5.0.jar's folder. (Has to be a valid file, which was produced by running placing-1.5.0.jar with the *mappingToPlacing.xml* as input, which was generated by mapping-1.5.0.jar with the *cdfFile* generated by converter-1.5.0.jar with codemetropolis-toolchain-commons.graph as input)

### Steps
1.  Run the following command in the folder of rendering-1.5.0.jar:
	```cmd
	java -jar rendering-1.5.0.jar -w -i validPlacingToRendering.xml
	```

### Expected Result
The tool warns the user that the world path parameter's name value is missing then it ends the run of the program without errors and without creating the output file.
