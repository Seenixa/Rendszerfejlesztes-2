### Purpose
 The purpose of this test is to check how the issue's solution reacts to capitalized switch cases.

### Test File
- [[validPlacingToRendering.xml]]

### Pre-requisites	
- Java runtime 22
- Command line opened in the folder of rendering-1.5.0.jar
- A *validPlacingToRendering.xml* file exists in the rendering-1.5.0.jar's folder. (Has to be a valid file, which was produced by running placing-1.5.0.jar with the *mappingToPlacing.xml* as input, which was generated by mapping-1.5.0.jar with the *cdfFile* generated by converter-1.5.0.jar with codemetropolis-toolchain-commons.graph as input)

### Steps
1. Run the following command in the folder of rendering-1.5.0.jar:
	```cmd
	java -jar rendering-1.5.0.jar -i validPlacingToRendering.xml -W CodeMetroWorld
	``` 
	or 
	```cmd
	java -jar rendering-1.5.0.jar -i validPlacingToRendering.xml -WORLD CodeMetroWorld
	```

### Expected Result
The tool gives back a warning or error and the program will not finish running because the capitalized -W or -WORLD switch does not equal to the default -w or -world switch.
